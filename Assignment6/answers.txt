push - Incorrect implementation
    o can be null. We can fix the problem by adding "o != null" to the @pre.
    A counter example - If we put o as null the inv will be incorrect.

pop - Correct implementation

top - Correct implementation

isEmpty -Incorrect implementation.
       A counter example - if we put a size 1 linkedlist, we will get false, that is because 1 !=0.
       The inv on the other hand says that we will get True.
       We can fix it by changing the @post to "@post @return == true iff elements.size() == 0"
